## Maze generation algorithm

It is known that if we want to traverse a graph we can use either the depth first or the breath first search. Additionally, those methods correspond to ways of exploring a maze. Î™n this project used the reverse way. Let's consider a graph nxn, in which the nodes correspond to the rooms of the maze. Initially we consider that each node is connected to all its neighboring nodes. The corner nodes have two neighbors, nodes on the periphery of the graph but not in the corners have three neighbors and internal nodes have four neighbors.

Consider a maze as shown in the following image:

### Algorithm

1. We begin from a graph's node.

2. We note that we visited this node and retrieve the list of neighboring nodes. We choose randomly a neighboring node and then:

  * If we have not visited the neighboring node, move to this node, store the edge between two nodes and recursively continue the procedure from step 2 with the neighboring element.

Basically, we implement a depth first search of the graph.

When the algorithm terminates, one new graph is created. The vertices are the vertices of the original graph and the edges are the edges we followed. The resulting graph is a maze.

The program runs with following command:

```
python make_maze.py <n> <start_x> <start_y> <seed> <output_file>
```
The program has four parameters:

*  `n` is the number of rows and column of the graph. The maximum value is 30. 
*  `start_x` is the x coordinate of the start point, with `0 <= start_x < n`.
*  `start_y` is the y coordinate of the start point,, with `0 <= start_y < n`.
*  `seed` is a numeric or string value.
*  `output_file` is the file to save the maze.
